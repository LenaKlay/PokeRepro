<h2>Why using an automatised workflow?</h2>
<p>When you are coding, your life is a succession of: launching your code,
waiting while it runs, discovering an issue and â€¦ restarting from scratch:</p>

<p>So, to make your code life easier you can <strong>automatised your worklow so that
re-running all your analysis only consist in running one file</strong>!</p>
<p>Dependencies between the different steps of your analysis workflow have to be
stated by using a <code>make.R</code> file <span style="color: grey;">(easy if your
worklow is linear that is to say if one step leads to another unique one)</span> or <span style="color: purple;">the targets package</span> <span style="color: grey;">(easier to use than the <code>make.R</code> file if your worklow is not linear)</span></p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will see the two methods starting with the <code>make.R</code> file.
