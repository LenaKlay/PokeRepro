<h2>Why using an automatised workflow?</h2>
<p>When you are coding, your life is a succession of: launching your code,
waiting while it runs, discovering an issue and â€¦ restarting from scratch:</p>

</div>
<p>So, to make your code life easier you can <strong>automatised your worklow so that
re-running all your analysis only consist in running one file</strong>!</p>
<p>Dependencies between the different steps of your analysis workflow have to be
stated by using a <code>make.R</code> file <span style="color: grey;">(easy if your
worklow is linear that is to say if one step leads to another unique one)</span> or <span style="color: purple;">the targets package</span> <span style="color: grey;">(easier to use than the <code>make.R</code> file if your worklow is not linear)</span></p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will see the two methods starting with the <code>make.R</code> file.
<strong>We assumed that you have already done the</strong> <em>03 - Create and define your first R function and analysis script</em></p>
</div>
<div id="a---using-the-make.r-file" class="section level2">
<h2>A - Using the <code>make.R</code> file</h2>
<p>You have to create a <code>make.R</code> file on the project root, for instance by using
<span style="color: purple;">the file.create() function</span> or by using
<em>File &gt; New File &gt; Rscript</em> if using RStudio and then saving the file on the
project root:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Command to create a make.R file on the project root if not done before:
file.create(&quot;make.R&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This file will contains everything needed to run your project: for instance
loading the dependencies your project relies on, functions you have coded,
sourcing scripts containing code for your analysis <em>etc.</em>. In this method,
running this folder will run the whole workflow!</p>
<p><span style="color: aquamarine;">A - 1 - Load the data and depencies </span></p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing to code in the <code>make.R</code> file is to <strong>automatise the data loading</strong>.<br />
To do so you must use <span style="color: purple;">the here package</span>
(<a href="https://here.r-lib.org/">link to the here website</a>): it helps to use <strong>relative paths</strong>
(defined on the project root) instead of absolute ones as everyone as a different
absolute path.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In our example</em>, we will load the <em>Pokemon</em> dataset, which is in the <code>data folder</code> on the project root.<br />
We use </span><span style="color: purple;">the here() function of the here package</span> the different arguments = parameters of the function are the folders of the path leading to the file and the name of the file to open as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code> # 1st line of the make.R: give the relative path to the data and read the data:
  data_poke &lt;- readr::read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;pokemon.csv&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Using package_name::function_name and not <code>library(package_name)</code> because
different functions belonging to different packages can have the same name, thus
using this coding style helps the code readability and prevent conflicts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, we must <strong>automatise dependencies loading</strong> that is to say the name of the
packages used in the functions we have created and defined.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reminder:</em> In the tutorial <em>03 - Create and define your first R function and analysis script</em>, these dependencies have been added to the <code>Import</code> part of the <code>DESCRIPTION file</code> by
using the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># command to add dependencies to the DESCRIPTION file:
usethis::use_package(&quot;name_of_the_package&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To install the dependencies your project is relying on, use </span> <span style="color: purple;">the install_deps() function of the devtools package</span> as follow:</p>
<pre class="r"><code> # 2nd line of the make.R: install dependencies
devtools::install_deps()</code></pre>
<p>The first two lines of the <code>make.R</code> file are coded!</p>

</div>
<p><span style="color: aquamarine;">A - 2 - Source your R functions </span></p>
<p>If you have defined and coded specific R functions collected in the <code>R folder</code> on the project root, you have to source them. It allows the use of these functions in the R scripts for the analysis. To do so, you use </span> <span style="color: purple;">the source function</span> and
we <strong>never forget to use relative paths using </span> <span style="color: purple;">the here package</span></strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code> # 3rd and 4rth lines of the make.R: load defined functions of the R folder
source(here::here(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;01_clean_data_function.R&quot;))
source(here::here(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;02_plot_function.R&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Now our functions are sourced!</p>

<p><span style="color: aquamarine;">A - 3 - Source your R scripts for analysis </span></p>
<p>Then, the last step is to run the R script</p>
