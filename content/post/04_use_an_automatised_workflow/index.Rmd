## Why using an automatised workflow? 


When you are coding, your life is a succession of: launching your code,

So, to make your code life easier you can **automatised your worklow so that 
re-running all your analysis only consist in running one file**!


Dependencies between the different steps of your analysis workflow have to be 
stated by using a `make.R` file <span style="color: grey;">(easy if your 
worklow is linear that is to say if one step leads to another unique one)</span> or <span style="color: purple;">the targets package</span> <span style="color: grey;">(easier to use than the `make.R` file if your worklow is not linear)</span>


In this tutorial, we will see the two methods starting with the `make.R` file.
