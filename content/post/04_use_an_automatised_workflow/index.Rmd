## Why using an automatised workflow? 


When you are coding, your life is a succession of: launching your code, 
waiting while it runs, discovering an issue and ... restarting from scratch:

So, to make your code life easier you can **automatised your worklow so that 
re-running all your analysis only consist in running one file**!


Dependencies between the different steps of your analysis workflow have to be 
stated by using a `make.R` file <span style="color: grey;">(easy if your 
worklow is linear that is to say if one step leads to another unique one)</span> or <span style="color: purple;">the targets package</span> <span style="color: grey;">(easier to use than the `make.R` file if your worklow is not linear)</span>


In this tutorial, we will see the two methods starting with the `make.R` file. 
**We assumed that you have already done the** *03 - Create and define your first R function and analysis script* 



## Using the `make.R` file


In the tutorial *01 Let's Create a Research Compendium!*, you have already 
created a `make.R` file on the project root.  If not, you can create it by using:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Command to create a make.R file on the project root if not done before:
file.create("make.R")

```


This file will contains everything needed to run your project: for instance
loading the dependencies your project relies on, functions you have coded, 
sourcing scripts containing code for your analysis *etc.*


<span style="color: aquamarine;">1 - Load the data and depencies </span> 


* The first thing to code in the `make.R` file is to **automatise the data loading**.  
To do so you must use <span style="color: purple;">the here package</span> 
([link to the here website](https://here.r-lib.org/)): it helps to use **relative paths** 
(defined on the project root) instead of absolute ones as everyone as a different 
absolute path. 

<span style="color: grey;">*In our example*, we will load the *Pokemon* dataset, which is in the `data folder` on the project root.  
We use </span> <span style="color: purple;">the here() function of the here package</span> </span> <span style="color: grey;">: the different arguments = parameters of the function are the folders of the path leading to the file and the name of the file to open as follows: </span> 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
 # give the relative path to the data and read the data:
  data_poke <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "pokemon.csv"))
```
 

**NOTE:** Using package_name::function_name and not `library(package_name)` because
different functions belonging to different packages can have the same name, thus
using this coding style helps the code readability and prevent conflicts.


* Then, we must **automatise dependencies loading** that is to say the name of the 
packages used in the functions we have created and defined.  

*Reminder:* In the tutorial *03 - Create and define your first R function and analysis script*, these dependencies have been added to the `Import` part of the `DESCRIPTION file` by
using the following command:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# command to add dependencies to the DESCRIPTION file:
usethis::use_package("name_of_the_package")
```
