<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This website is the result of a project made during a teaching unit done by the
<a href="https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/">FRB-CESAB</a>
in Montpellier (December 2021). All informations given in this website are
based on the <a href="https://frbcesab.github.io/datatoolbox/">toolbox</a> done for the teaching.</p>
<p>This website is about coding in a reproducible workflow <strong>using R</strong> and is especially made for ecological studies but most concepts can be used for any study.</p>

<h2>What is Reproducible Research?</h2>
<p>Doing a <strong>reproducible research</strong> is providing a “clean, repeatable script-based workflow” <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf">Bristish Ecological Society 2018</a> linking raw data to final analysis and outupts. It is important to follow a reproducible workflow so that <strong>other people can re-run your code or that a future version of you can easily redo the analysis</strong>!</p>
<p>It relies on several important points that are explained in the different tutorials (<em>cf Tutorials and examples</em> down below):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span style="color: aquamarine;">Project organisation:</span> you have to correctly organise your working directory by creating a Research Compendium which have defined directories (<em>cf Let’s Create a Research Compendium</em> tutorial)</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: aquamarine;">Data management:</span> you have to <strong>keep raw data</strong> and
save intermediate data. <strong>Never</strong> overwrite raw data!<br />
If raw data you used is download, it is better if you automate their obtention <span style="color: grey;">(using <code>download.file()</code> function for instance)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: aquamarine;">Softwares - Scripts:</span> you have to <strong>respect the agreements of the community you work in</strong>, for instance style rules on objects names or scripts aesthetic <span style="color: grey;">(example: <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse rules</a>)</span>. One basic rule when writing R scripts is for instance to always use a relative path (where the file is according to the working directory)</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: aquamarine;">Softwares - Environment:</span> you have to indicate the version of used packages (<em>cf</em> <span style="color: purple;">the renv package</span> using the <em>Create and isolted and portable environment using renv</em> tutorial) because some functions/parameters can change between packages versions. You can also track the version of R you are working on or the Operating System version (<span style="color: grey;">using for instance</span> <span style="color: purple;">the Docker package</span> <em>cf</em> <a href="https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/">Introduction of Docker for R Users by Colin Fay</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: aquamarine;">Softwares - Workflow:</span> scripts succession can be automated using a <code>make.R</code> file (<em>cf Let’s Create a Research Compendium</em> tutorial) or <span style="color: purple;">the target package:</span> (<em>cf Create an automatised workflow</em> tutorial)</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: aquamarine;">Tracking Changes:</span> using a version control software as <span style="color: purple;">Git</span> (<em>cf Use Git and Github</em> tutorial).</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: aquamarine;">Collaboration:</span> you have to use a place to exchange to share your code, where you can collaborate with others and where other people can suggest modifications or improvement of your code throught <span style="color: purple;">Github or GitLab</span> (<em>cf Use Git and Github</em> tutorial). To be able to collaborate with others you also have to <strong>document</strong> your project, notably by using a <code>README</code> file (<em>cf Let’s Create a Research Compendium</em> tutorial)</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: aquamarine;">Manuscripts:</span> you can automate the writing process by using <strong>literate programming</strong> combining writing, code and figures using <span style="color: purple;">Rmarkdown</span></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tutorials and examples</h2>
<p>In this website, we propose a set of tutorials to learn how to do reproducible research!<br />
Each tutorial contains R chunks so you can run the analysis using a <strong>Pokemon dataset</strong> from the Kaggle website (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon">link</a>) which gathers informations like Basic Statistics, Type, Height, Weight <em>etc</em> for 802 Pokemons. We will create a reproducible project to answer two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the attack ability evolve with height and weight?</li>
<li>Which pokemon type has the highest proportion of legendary pokemons?</li>
</ul>
<p>We used R and RStudio (so screenshots are made under Rstudio). So that the tutorials correctly work, <strong>please be sure that you have a R version &gt;= 4.0.0, that Git, Github are configurated to communicate with R and that your computer have everything needed to read Rmarkdown file</strong>.
<a href="https://frbcesab.github.io/datatoolbox/instructions.html">Here</a> are instructions to do so (<em>in french</em>)</p>
<p>If you are new to the subject, you can follow the tutorials in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - Let’s Create a Research Compendium!</p></li>
<li><p>2 - Use Git and Github</p></li>
<li><p>3 - Create and define your first R function and analysis script</p></li>
<li><p>4 - Create an automatised workflow: using make.R or the targets package</p></li>
<li><p>5 - Create and isolated and portable environment using renv</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s do reproducible research!</p>
