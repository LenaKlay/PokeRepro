<p>Now you are suppose to have a beautiful project structure link to gitHub. Now that we finished to create the basis of the project we will start it ! We will beging by creat a new function.</p>
<p>To do so we will create a new script. As we said we will use the R file to put inside R scripts that construct functions. The name of the script is really important, we will call it 01_clean_data_function.R. Each script that create function will finish by “function”. We will create a function to clean the dataset.</p>
<p>We open 01_clean_data_function.R and we write :</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokeclean &lt;- function(poke){
  poke2 &lt;- poke[-rowSums(is.na(poke[,])) == 0, ]
  poke3 &lt;- poke2[,-c()]
  return(poke3)
}</code></pre>
