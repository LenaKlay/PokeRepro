<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The basis of reproducibility is writing <strong>R functions</strong> instead of duplicating your code. Using functions helps you to have cleaner scripts and helps others to better understand your code: if you have weel-written functions with associated documentation, then others only have to read the documentation of your functions to understand your code. It’s way better than reading thousands of comments, right? No, let’s have a look at this wonderful and easy code technique that will revolutionize your code!</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>A function is a R object which <span style="color: aquamarine;">take as inputs objects that will feed the function</span>, <span style="color: aquamarine;">apply</span> to these inputs <span style="color: aquamarine;">some operations you define</span> and then <span style="color: aquamarine;">give as outputs the results you want to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: grey;">In this tutorial we will create together one function from A to Z and the associated documentation which is <strong>really important</strong>. This function will clean the Pokemon Dataset and only keep Pokemons from the first, second and third generations and … </span></p>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-new-r-file-that-will-contain-the-function" class="section level2">
<h2>1 - Creating a new R file that will contain the function</h2>
<p>You have to create a new <strong>R script</strong> in the <strong>R folder</strong> of your Research Compendium.
This <strong>R folder</strong> must contain all the functions you code by yourself and want to use in your analysis.</p>
<p><strong>At the begining of this new R script</strong>, you can add rows which explain what is in the script, when it was coded, by who <em>etc</em> as follow:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/rscript_structure.PNG" width="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Screenshot of the begining of a R script</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The name of this R script that will contain a function</strong>, must have a really clear name (according to what you do in your script) and you can use a number at the begining of the script name to know thereafter in which order scripts and functions must be used. <span style="color: grey;">In our example, can name the R script “01_clean_data_function.R”. The name explain that in this script which have to be used in the first place, a function is coded to clean a dataset </span></p>
<p>Then, your file is ready to welcome your wonderful new function!</p>
</div>
<div id="defining-your-function" class="section level2">
<h2>2 - Defining your function</h2>
<p>The first step when writing a function is to <strong>define it</strong>.</p>
<p>To do so you just have to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>chose the name you will give to your function: <span style="color: grey;">in our example, the function will be called <em>pokeclean</em> as it cleans the Pokemon dataset.</span></p></li>
<li><p>chose which objects are needed as inputs for your function to work: <span style="color: grey;">in our example, we just need the Pokemon dataset called <em>poke</em> </span></p></li>
<li><p>follow the following coding style:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: grey;">function_name &lt;- function(list here the inputs) {</span></p>
<p><span style="color: grey;">}</span></p>
<p><span style="color: grey;"> The definition of the function cleaning the Pokemon dataset will thus looks as follow:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokeclean &lt;- function(poke){
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>Great, you have defined your first function!</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
</div>
<div id="coding-your-function" class="section level2">
<h2>3 - Coding your function</h2>
<p>Then, the next step is to complete the function with all the operations we want to do, replacing the “…” in the above code.</p>
<p>To do so, you can create intermediate objects that help you to store intermediate objects needed for the computation of your function, you can call other functions that you have already created or that belong to R base or R packages <em>etc.</em>
<strong>Never forget to comment your function!</strong> Because if other people (or you several months from now) want to understand each line of your function, they should be able to do so!</p>
<p><span style="color: grey;">In our example the function looks as follow:</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokeclean &lt;- function(poke){
  
  # only keep 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations:
  poke2 &lt;- poke[-poke$generation %in% c(&quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;), ]
  
  # remove japanese name and classification informations: 
  poke3 &lt;- poke2[,-which(names(poke2) %in% c(&quot;japanese_name&quot;,&quot;classfication&quot;))]
}</code></pre>
<p><span style="color: aquamarine;">When you code your function, <strong>never forget</strong> these Coding Styles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>if you <strong>call a function from a R package</strong>, use <code>package_name::function_name()</code> instead of only <code>function_name()</code>. <span style="color: aquamarine;">Why?</span> If you use <code>function_name()</code>, then you will have to call the package it belongs to by using the <code>library(package_name)</code> command. But, you should never use <code>library(package_name)</code> because different functions belonging to different packages can have the same name, thus using this coding style helps the code readability and prevent conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p>if you <strong>call a function from a R package</strong>, you should add this package to the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file. Do do so, you can directly write in the consol <code>usethis:use_package(package_name)</code> and it will automatiquely add it to the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, you have to chose the object(s) to return as output(s) of your function. To do so, you use the <code>return()</code> function (quite easy right?).</p>
<p><span style="color: grey;">In our example, we want to return the cleaned dataset called <em>poke3</em>, thus the full function looks as follow:</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>pokeclean &lt;- function(poke){
  
  # only keep 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations:
  poke2 &lt;- poke[-poke$generation %in% c(&quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;), ]
  
  # remove japanese name and classification informations: 
  poke3 &lt;- poke2[,-which(names(poke2) %in% c(&quot;japanese_name&quot;,&quot;classfication&quot;))]
  
  # return the cleaned dataset:
  return(pokecleaned = poke3)
}</code></pre>
<p>Your first function is now finished, congratulations!</p>

</div>
<p>You now need one last step which is essential if you want others (or you in several months) to use your function…</p>
</div>
<div id="documenting-your-function" class="section level2">
<h2>3 - Documenting your function</h2>
<p>… Yes, you need to document your function which means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>explain what is the purpose of your function</p></li>
<li><p>describe each input your function needs, that is to say describing its type and what it represents</p></li>
<li><p>describe what the function returns</p></li>
<li><p>add any note you think is interesting for the user</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It will allow you to have an acces to the help menu doing ?myfunction.</p>
<p>To do so, you must create a <em>Roxygen squeleton</em> created by the <span style="color: purple;">the roxygen2 package</span>. Don’t worry, it is very simple: move your cursor inside the function you just created (like the following picture) and then, in Rstudio, go on <em>Code</em> &gt; <em>Insert Roxygen Squeleton</em> (you can also write the roxygen squeletton by yourself).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/function_cursor.PNG" width="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Move your cursor inside the function definition</p>
</div>
<p><span style="color: grey;">In our example, it will render something like that:</span></p>
<p>#’ Title <br>
#’ <span class="citation">@param</span> poke <br>
#‘<br>
#’ <span class="citation">@return&lt;br</span>&gt;
#’ <br>
#’ <span class="citation">@export</span> <br>
#‘<br>
#’ <span class="citation">@examples</span> <br></p>
<p>Now we are going to go through each row:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the first row #’<strong>Title</strong> must be the … Title of your function. This question was quite difficult I know ;)
<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we will write: Function which clean the Pokemon dataset by selecting only 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and removing japanese name and classification</span>
In fact, you can also have a first row refering to the global name of your function (<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we can write: Cleaning the Pokemon dataset</span>) and then a second row going more into details about your function (<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we can write: this function cleans the Pokemon dataset by selecting only 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and removing japanese name and classification</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>the second row #’<strong><span class="citation">@param</span></strong> must be followed by the name of the input. You should have as many <span class="citation">@param</span> lines as you have inputs. It must look like that <code>@param name_of_the_input description of the input</code>. The description of the inputs must describe the type of input (list, vector, dataframe, matrix <em>etc</em>), what it contains and any information you think is usefull to understand the input.
<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we will write: <span class="citation">@param</span> poke a dataframe gathering the information about Pokemons. It was downloaded at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon</a>. </span>
In this function <code>pokeclean</code>, we do not have any other inputs so we will only have one line called <span class="citation">@param</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>the third row #’<strong><span class="citation">@return</span></strong> must contain the name of the output(s) and what they contain. You only have one <span class="citation">@return</span> row even if the function as several outputs. In fact, if your function returns several outputs, they will be gathered in a unique list or vector, thus the output will be one unique object.
<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we will write: <span class="citation">@return</span> pokecleaned a dataframe gathering the information about Pokemons with only Pokemons from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and with no information about their japanese names and classifications.</span></p></li>
<li><p>the fourth row, #’<strong><span class="citation">@export</span></strong> tells <span style="color: purple;">the roxygen2</span> to add this function to the <code>NAMESPACE</code> file, so that it will be accessible when you want to use it.</p></li>
<li><p>the fifth row #’<strong><span class="citation">@example</span></strong> can contain an working example of how to use your function. It is not mandatory and here we will not give any example.</p></li>
<li><p>then, you can add other rows (called <em>tags</em> in the <span style="color: purple;">the roxygen2</span> language)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: grey;">So, in our example, the updated roxygen squeleton will look as follow (with no empty lines:</span></p>
<p>#’ Cleaning the Pokemon dataset <br>
#’ <br>
#’ This function cleans the Pokemon dataset by selecting only 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and removing <br>
#’ japanese name and classification <br>
#’ <br>
#’ <span class="citation">@param</span> poke a dataframe gathering the information about Pokemons. It was downloaded at <br>
#’ <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon</a>. <br>
#’ <br>
#’ <span class="citation">@return</span> pokecleaned a dataframe gathering the information about Pokemons with only Pokemons from the
#’ 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and with no information about their japanese names and classifications. <br>
#’ <br>
#’ <span class="citation">@export</span> <br></p>
<p>And now it is done! You have successfully coded and documented your function, you are an intermediate warrior in code reproducibility!</p>

<div id="lets-use-this-new-function" class="section level2">
<h2>5 - Let’s use this new function!</h2>
<p>Now that you have coded your function, you can use it! To do so you create a <strong>new R script</strong> in the <strong>analysis</strong>folder. As said in <em>1 - Create a research Compendium</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>the <span style="color: aquamarine;">analysis</span> folder of your Research Compendium gathers scripts used for analysis</strong>. In these scripts you can call functions you have coded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>functions you have coded are gathered in the <span style="color: aquamarine;">R</span> folder of your Research Compendium</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>As when creating a new R script for function, the top of your R script can contain some <strong>rows to explain what is doing the script, who wrote it</strong> <em>etc</em>. It is very recommended to do so for each R script you are coding.</p>
<p>You must also give a file name which clearly explains what is inside the analysis file and you can use a number at the begining of the script name to know thereafter in which order scripts must be used. <span style="color: grey;">For example, we will call this new analysis script “01_clean_data.R”</span></p>
<p>Then, you can write code for analysis and comments (<strong>never forget that commenting is the basis of any reproducible workflow ;)</strong>)!<br />
<span style="color: grey;">In this analysis, the code is really short and just call the function we just coded as you can see below: </span></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Ranalysis1.PNG" width="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">First R analysis script</p>
</div>
<p>As we just said, it is a very very simple example: most of the time, the script has several lines which call or not one or several function coded by the owner of the research compendium… or not! Just keep in mind that you gather in such a script the coding stuff for <strong>a given analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>So yay! First R analysis created! Now, you have to create as many functions and as many analysis as needed in your Research Compendium and then, have a look at the <a href="https://poke-reproducibility.netlify.app/2021/11/29/create-an-automatised-workflow-using-make.r/">Create an automatised workflow: using make.R tutorial</a>.</p>

<div id="create-new-functions-and-new-analysis-scripts" class="section level2">
<h2>6 - Create new functions and new analysis scripts</h2>
<p>In this Research Compendium, we have created three other R functions saved in
the <code>R</code> folder of the Research Compendium:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one for cleaning a pokemon dataframe
(<code>prep.pokeplot()</code> function)</p></li>
<li><p>one for plotting the frequence pokemons’s types and relationships between attack
capacities and pokemon’s weight according to Pokemon’s generation given two
pokemon datasets (<code>poke.plot01()</code> function). What is interesting in this function is
that we used a <code>save</code> argument which can be set to <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> to save or not
the plot in the <span style="color: aquamarine;">outputs</span> folder. It is really
easy to do so, you can have a look at the associated code in the <code>poke.plot01</code> function:
in this function we used the <code>ggsave</code> function from the <code>ggplot2</code> package but you can
use whatever function you want:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/save_arg.jpg" width="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">How to save a graph/table according to a save argument</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>one for computing the linear regression model of attack ~ weight
(<code>regression.attack.weight()</code> function)</li>
</ul>
<p>And created two associated analysis scripts saved in
the <code>analysis</code> folder of the Research Compendium::</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one for plotting the correlation between weight and attack using
<code>prep.pokeplot()</code> and <code>poke.plot01()</code> functions</p></li>
<li><p>one for computing the linear regression model of attack ~ weight using
the <code>regression.attack.weight()</code> function</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can have a look at these <a href="https://github.com/LenaKlay/PokeRepro/tree/main/R">functions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LenaKlay/PokeRepro/tree/main/analysis">analysis</a> scripts to be sure to fully
understand the function structure and their use!</p>
