## Introduction


The basis of reproducibility is writing **R functions** instead of duplicating your code. Using functions helps you to have cleaner scripts and helps others to better understand your code: if you have weel-written functions with associated documentation, then others only have to read the documentation of your functions to understand your code. It's way better than reading thousands of comments, right? No, let's have a look at this wonderful and easy code technique that will revolutionize your code!

A function is a R object which <span style="color: aquamarine;">take as inputs objects that will feed the function</span>, <span style="color: aquamarine;">apply</span> to these inputs <span style="color: aquamarine;">some operations you define</span> and then <span style="color: aquamarine;">give as outputs the results you want to have.</span>


<span style="color: grey;">In this tutorial we will create together one function from A to Z and the associated documentation which is **really important**. This function will clean the Pokemon Dataset and only keep Pokemons from the first, second and third generations and ... </span>


## 1 - Creating a new R file that will contain the function


You have to create a new **R script** in the **R folder** of your Research Compendium. 
This **R folder** must contain all the functions you code by yourself and want to use in your analysis.

**At the begining of this new R script**, you can add rows which explain what is in the script, when it was coded, by who *etc* as follow:


![Screenshot of the begining of a R script](images/rscript_structure.PNG){width=700px}



**The name of this R script that will contain a function**, must have a really clear name (according to what you do in your script) and you can use a number at the begining of the script name to know thereafter in which order scripts and functions must be used. <span style="color: grey;">In our example, can name the R script "01_clean_data_function.R". The name explain that in this script which have to be used in the first place, a function is coded to clean a dataset </span> 


Then, your file is ready to welcome your wonderful new function!



## 2 - Defining your function


The first step when writing a function is to **define it**. 

To do so you just have to:

* chose the name you will give to your function: <span style="color: grey;">in our example, the function will be called *pokeclean* as it cleans the Pokemon dataset.</span>

* chose which objects are needed as inputs for your function to work: <span style="color: grey;">in our example,  we just need the Pokemon dataset called *poke* </span> 

* follow the following coding style:

<span style="color: grey;">function_name <- function(list here the inputs) {</span>

<span style="color: grey;">}</span> 


<span style="color: grey;"> The definition of the function cleaning the Pokemon dataset will thus looks as follow:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pokeclean <- function(poke){
  ...
}
```


Great, you have defined your first function!

## 3 - Coding your function


Then, the next step is to complete the function with all the operations we want to do, replacing the "..." in the above code.

To do so, you can create intermediate objects that help you to store intermediate objects needed for the computation of your function, you can call other functions that you have already created or that belong to R base or R packages *etc.*
**Never forget to comment your function!** Because if other people (or you several months from now) want to understand each line of your function, they should be able to do so!


<span style="color: grey;">In our example the function looks as follow:</span> 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
pokeclean <- function(poke){
  
  # only keep 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations:
  poke2 <- poke[-poke$generation %in% c("4", "5", "6", "7"), ]
  
  # remove japanese name and classification informations: 
  poke3 <- poke2[,-which(names(poke2) %in% c("japanese_name","classfication"))]
}
```



<span style="color: aquamarine;">When you code your function, **never forget** these Coding Styles:</span>

* if you **call a function from a R package**, use `package_name::function_name()` instead of only `function_name()`. <span style="color: aquamarine;">Why?</span> If you use `function_name()`, then you will have to call the package it belongs to by using the `library(package_name)` command. But, you should never use `library(package_name)` because different functions belonging to different packages can have the same name, thus using this coding style helps the code readability and prevent conflicts.

* if you **call a function from a R package**, you should add this package to the `DESCRIPTION` file. Do do so, you can directly write in the consol `usethis:use_package(package_name)` and it will automatiquely add it to the `DESCRIPTION` file.


Then, you have to chose the object(s) to return as output(s) of your function. To do so, you use the `return()` function (quite easy right?). 

<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we want to return the cleaned dataset called *poke3*, thus the full function looks as follow:</span> 



```{r, eval = FALSE}
pokeclean <- function(poke){
  
  # only keep 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations:
  poke2 <- poke[-poke$generation %in% c("4", "5", "6", "7"), ]
  
  # remove japanese name and classification informations: 
  poke3 <- poke2[,-which(names(poke2) %in% c("japanese_name","classfication"))]
  
  # return the cleaned dataset:
  return(pokecleaned = poke3)
}
```


Your first function is now finished, congratulations!

You now need one last step which is essential if you want others (or you in several months) to use your function...



## 3 - Documenting your function


... Yes, you need to document your function which means:

* explain what is the purpose of your function

* describe each input your function needs, that is to say describing its type and what it represents

* describe what the function returns

* add any note you think is interesting for the user


It will allow you to have an acces to the help menu doing ?myfunction. 


To do so, you must create a *Roxygen squeleton* created by the <span style="color: purple;">the roxygen2 package</span>. Don't worry, it is very simple: move your cursor inside the function you just created (like the following picture) and then, in Rstudio, go on *Code* > *Insert Roxygen Squeleton* (you can also write the roxygen squeletton by yourself).

![Move your cursor inside the function definition](images/function_cursor.PNG){width=700px}

<span style="color: grey;">In our example, it will render something like that:</span> 


#' Title <br>
#' @param poke <br>
#'<br>
#' @return<br>
#' <br>
#' @export <br>
#'<br>
#' @examples <br>


Now we are going to go through each row:

* the first row #'**Title** must be the ... Title of your function. This question was quite difficult I know ;) 
<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we will write: Function which clean the Pokemon dataset by selecting only 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and removing japanese name and classification</span>
In fact, you can also have a first row refering to the global name of your function (<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we can write: Cleaning the Pokemon dataset</span>) and then a second row going more into details about your function (<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we can write: this function cleans the Pokemon dataset by selecting only 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and removing japanese name and classification</span>).


* the second row #'**@param** must be followed by the name of the input. You should have as many @param lines as you have inputs. It must look like that `@param name_of_the_input description of the input`. The description of the inputs must describe the type of input (list, vector, dataframe, matrix *etc*), what it contains and any information you think is usefull to understand the input. 
<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we will write: @param poke a dataframe gathering the information about Pokemons. It was downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon. </span> 
In this function  `pokeclean`, we do not have any other inputs so we will only have one line called @param.


* the third row  #'**@return** must contain the name of the output(s) and what they contain. You only have one @return row even if the function as several outputs. In fact, if your function returns several outputs, they will be gathered in a unique list or vector, thus the output will be one unique object. 
<span style="color: grey;">In our example, we will write: @return pokecleaned a dataframe gathering the information about Pokemons with only Pokemons from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and with no information about their japanese names and classifications.</span> 


* the fourth row, #'**@export** tells <span style="color: purple;">the roxygen2</span> to add this function to the `NAMESPACE` file, so that it will be accessible when you want to use it.


* the fifth row #'**@example** can contain an working example of how to use your function. It is not mandatory and here we will not give any example.


* then, you can add other rows (called *tags* in the <span style="color: purple;">the roxygen2</span> language)  


<span style="color: grey;">So, in our example, the updated roxygen squeleton will look as follow (with no empty lines:</span>


#' Cleaning the Pokemon dataset <br>
#'  <br>
#' This function cleans the Pokemon dataset by selecting only 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and removing <br>
#' japanese name and classification <br>
#' <br>
#' @param poke a dataframe gathering the information about Pokemons. It was downloaded at <br>
#' https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon. <br>
#' <br>
#' @return pokecleaned a dataframe gathering the information about Pokemons with only Pokemons from the 
#' 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations and with no information about their japanese names and classifications.  <br>
#' <br>
#' @export  <br>



And now it is done! You have successfully coded and documented your function, you are an intermediate warrior in code reproducibility!

## 5 - Let's use this new function!


Now that you have coded your function, you can use it! To do so you create a **new R script** in the **analysis**folder. As said in *1 - Create a research Compendium*:

* **the <span style="color: aquamarine;">analysis</span> folder of your Research Compendium gathers scripts used for analysis**. In these scripts you can call functions you have coded.

* **functions you have coded are gathered in the <span style="color: aquamarine;">R</span> folder of your Research Compendium**


As when creating a new R script for function, the top of your R script can contain some **rows to explain what is doing the script, who wrote it** *etc*. It is very recommended to do so for each R script you are coding.


You must also give a file name which clearly explains what is inside the analysis file and you can use a number at the begining of the script name to know thereafter in which order scripts must be used. <span style="color: grey;">For example, we will call this new analysis script "01_clean_data.R"</span>


Then, you can write code for analysis and comments (**never forget that commenting is the basis of any reproducible workflow ;)**)!  
<span style="color: grey;">For example, we will call this new analysis script "01_clean_data.R"</span>

COMPLETE HERE AND SAY WHAT IS INSIDE AND THAT IT CAN BE MORE COMPLICATED AND THAT HERE IT IS A REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT AS SEVERAL ROWS which call or not functions coded by the owner of the research compendium






## 6 - Create new functions and new analysis scripts




Now let's say that you have to create a function to plot something. Because this function isn't link with data manipulation we will create a new script R. We will call it **02_plot_function.R**

```{r, eval=FALSE}

```



We will create another function but this time it will concern. 
-on creer une function dans le dossier R “01_clean_data_function”
-dans analysis on creer “01_clean_data.R”. 

-on creer une function dans le dossier R “02_plot_function.R”
-dans analysis on creer “02_plot.R”

-dans analysis on creer “03_which_type.R” 
-dans ouputs on creer “03_which_type_barplot.png”  
-dans ouputs on creer “03_which_type_camemmbert.png”  
 
-dans analysis on creer “04_regression_weight_attack.R” 
-dans ouputs on creer “04_regression_weight_attack.png” 
-dans ouputs on creer “04_regression_weight_attack.RDATA”

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
poke <- read.csv("~/Desktop/PHD1/Formation/Reproductibility/PokeRepro/data/pokemon.csv")
a <- as.data.frame(table(poke$type1))
```
